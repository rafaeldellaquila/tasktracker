This is a Task Tracker that you can put your tasks for the day and count how long it takes to do them.

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Write a task on input and put play to run the timer and stop when is done.

## My process

We use the Vue.js 3 Tools and Bulma for the styles.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
-   [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

I'am learning how to work better with Vue.js 3 and how work this CSS frameworks because i have used other extensions like SASS, Stylus and Styled-Components but i never used something like Bulma or Tailwind.
